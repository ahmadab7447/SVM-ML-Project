# 🧠 Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Classification

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to solve a classification problem using Python and Scikit-learn. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to demonstrate the power of SVMs for binary classification tasks.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a classification model using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** that accurately classifies data points into predefined categories based on input features.

---

## 🧾 Key Steps Covered

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling Missing Values
- Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
- Train-Test Splitting
- Model Training with `sklearn.svm.SVC`
- Performance Evaluation:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - Decision boundary plots (if present)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for ML models)

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/svm-classification-project.git
   cd svm-classification-project


📈 Model Insights
The SVM model provides a robust boundary between classes by maximizing the margin between the nearest data points (support vectors).

Kernel trick (e.g., RBF kernel) can be used for non-linear decision boundaries.

Results are evaluated using a variety of metrics to ensure model reliability.
